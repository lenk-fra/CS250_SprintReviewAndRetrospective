# CS210_SprintReviewAndDeliverable
This is my Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from my final project

# Interpreting User Needs and Using User Stories
I interpret user needs by focusing on what the user is trying to accomplish, not just on technical requirements. Instead of thinking about features first, I think about the problem the user wants solved. Creating user stories helps with this because they describe functionality from the user’s point of view. For example, a user story like “As a customer, I want to search travel packages by destination so I can easily plan my trip” makes it clear who the user is, what they want, and why it matters. User stories also include acceptance criteria, which helps ensure the final product actually meets user expectations and avoids misunderstandings during development.

# My Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Processes
When developing programs, I prefer an iterative approach where work is broken into smaller pieces and improved over time. The Scrum-Agile process used in the SNHU Travel project showed how effective this can be. In the future, I hope to continue using Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. These processes help keep work organized, encourage regular feedback, and make it easier to adapt when requirements change. I also want to continue using retrospectives to reflect on what went well and what could be improved, because continuous improvement is a key part of Agile development.

# Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly, being accountable for assigned work, and supporting others on the team. It also means being open to feedback and willing to adjust when things change. During the SNHU Travel project, collaboration was important to completing user stories within each sprint. A good team member contributes to a positive team environment, helps remove obstacles when possible, and focuses on the shared goal of delivering quality software that meets user needs.
